I introduce an analysis about the number of bits needed to reproduce 
Huffman tree (decoding scheme). This data is fundamental, because it serves
to understand that the gain obtained by applying the set shaping theory 
does not imply an increase in the number of bits necessary to represent 
the decoding scheme (correspondence between codeword symbols).
